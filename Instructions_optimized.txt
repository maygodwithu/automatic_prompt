M1	Does the passage answer the query? Respond with 'Yes' or 'No'.	"Based on the given query and passage, determine if the passage directly answers the query. If the passage provides relevant information that directly addresses the query, respond with 'Yes'. If the passage does not provide relevant information or does not directly answer the query, respond with 'No'. When evaluating the relevance, focus on whether the passage contains specific and accurate information that directly addresses the query. Avoid considering general or unrelated information. Additionally, consider the context and language used in the passage to determine if it is providing a direct answer to the query."	"Evaluate if the passage directly answers the query or not. If the passage provides a clear and direct answer to the query, respond with ¡®yes¡¯. If the passage does not provide a clear and direct answer or if the information is ambiguous, incomplete, or unrelated to the query, respond with ¡®No¡¯. Consider the query and passage in their entirety, not just keywords or phrases."
M2	"Given a passage and a query, predict whether the passage includes an answer. Answer with 'Yes' or 'No'."	"Given a passage and a query, predict whether the passage provides a direct and relevant answer to the query. Answer with 'Yes' if the passage contains a clear and specific answer to the query, and 'No' if the passage does not provide a direct answer or the answer is vague or unrelated."	"Given a passage and a query, predict whether the passage includes an answer. Answer with 'Yes' if the passage directly provides the answer to the query, and 'No' if the passage does not provide the answer or if the answer is not directly stated. Pay close attention to the specific information requested in the query and determine if the passage contains that information. If the passage contains the requested information, answer 'Yes'. If the passage does not contain the requested information or if the answer is not directly stated, answer 'No'. Consider both the presence and relevance of the information in the passage when making your determination."
M3	Indicate if the passage is relevant for the query. Respond with 'Yes' or 'No'.	Determine if the passage provides relevant information to answer the query. Respond with 'Yes' if the passage contains information that directly addresses or answers the query. Respond with 'No' if the passage does not contain relevant information or does not directly address the query. Consider only the information that directly relates to the query and ignore any irrelevant or extraneous details.	"Evaluate the relevance of the passage to the query. If the passage directly answers the query or provides information that is directly related to the query, respond with 'Yes'. If the passage does not provide information that is directly related to the query or the information is tangential or unrelated, respond with 'No'. Consider the specific details of the query and the passage. If the passage provides information about a different but similar topic, it is not relevant. If the passage provides general information that does not directly address the specific query, it is not relevant. Be cautious of passages that may contain keywords from the query but do not provide a direct answer or relevant information to the query. Also, be aware that a passage may contain relevant terms but in a different context, which makes it irrelevant to the query. Be sure to consider the entirety of the passage and not just isolated sentences or phrases. If the passage contains multiple pieces of information, some of which are relevant and some of which are not, consider the overall relevance of the passage to the query. If the passage provides a partial answer to the query, consider the extent to which the query is answered and the importance of the information provided in relation to the query."
M4	"You are a search quality rater evaluating the relevance of passages. Given a query and a passages, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 2 with the following meanings: You are a search quality rater evaluating the relevance of passages. Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 2 with the following meanings: 2 = highly relevant, directly addresses the query and provides comprehensive and accurate information 1 = somewhat relevant, contains some relevant information but may also include irrelevant or incomplete content 0 = not relevant, does not address the query or provide any useful information When evaluating the relevance of a passage, consider whether it directly addresses the query and provides comprehensive and accurate information. Look for specific details, examples, or explanations that demonstrate a clear understanding of the query. Pay attention to the overall quality and usefulness of the information provided.  Keep in mind that a passage may be partially relevant if it contains some relevant information but also includes irrelevant or incomplete content. In such cases, assign a score of 1.  If a passage does not address the query or provide any useful information, assign a score of 0.  Please note that GPT's previous answers may not align with the ground truths. Take into account the ground truths provided and aim to align your evaluation more closely with them."	"You are a search quality rater evaluating the relevance of passages. Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 2 with the following meanings: 2 = highly relevant, very helpful for this query 1 = relevant, may be partly helpful but might contain other irrelevant content 0 = not relevant, should never be shown for this query When evaluating, consider the following: - The passage must directly answer or address the query to be considered relevant.  - If the passage contains the answer but also includes a significant amount of irrelevant information, it should be considered partly helpful.  - If the passage does not address the query at all, it is not relevant.  - Be careful not to mistake related topics for relevance. The passage must specifically address the query, not just the general topic.  - If the passage contains incorrect or misleading information in relation to the query, it should be considered not relevant.  - If the passage contains the correct information but it is not directly related to the query, it should be considered not relevant.  - If the passage contains the correct information but it is not comprehensive or detailed enough to fully answer the query, it should be considered partly helpful."
